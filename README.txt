A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/forbesg/pen/eNBLRa.

 Take two names (strings) and creates an array of the occurrances of the letters "l", "o", "v", "e" and "s".

The array is then reduced by adding each array value with the adjacent value until there are only two values are left.

These two integers are joined and converted to a string and displayed to the user as a percentage.
